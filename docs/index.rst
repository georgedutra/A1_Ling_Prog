A1 - Programming Language: The Neighbourhood data Analysis
==========================================================

Project developed for the Programming Languages discipline at EMAP FGV. 
The current project makes an scrapping at `Letras <https://www.letras.mus.br/the-neighbourhood/>`_ 
and `Spotify for Developers <https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/>`_ to collect data of 
The Neighbourhood. Using this data, we make some analysis and graphics to respond the proposed questions.
